# ECS32-Final-Project

The final project is to simulate a delivery truck. Each truck starts out empty but with a map that has the
addresses of the post service offices and of the possible places it might need to deliver to. The truck is
supposed to pick up all packages from all of the post service offices and deliver all the pakcages (but not
necessarilty in that order). The truck also knows what packages there are in each post service office.

Each package has an address and a name to which the package should be delivered. The goal is to pick
up and deliver all packages. By the end of Part 2, the fastest groups will gain extra credit.
The final project is broken into two parts. Part 1 is to set up the basic data structures. The description
of Part 1 is in Section . Part 2 is to find the fastest route of delivering all packages given a map and the
pakcagesâ€™ information.
